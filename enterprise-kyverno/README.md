## Policy-as-Code with Kyverno
[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) is a Kubernetes-native policy engine that empowers teams to enforce and automate best practices, security standards, and operational requirements across their Kubernetes clusters. Kyverno has gained significant traction within the open-source community, becoming a go-to solution for policy management.

While open-source Kyverno provides robust capabilities to define, validate, mutate, and enforce Kubernetes resource configurations, organizations operating at scale often face challenges in maintaining security and governance across complex environments. [Enterprise Kyverno (N4K)](https://nirmata.com/nirmata-enterprise-for-kyverno/) bridges this gap by strengthening the foundational capabilities of open-source Kyverno with secure defaults, enterprise-grade support, and integrations designed for scalability.

## Why Choose Enterprise Kyverno?
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Secure defaults and pre-built policy sets reduce misconfiguration risks and strengthen cluster security from day one.
* **Long-Term Version Compatbility:** N4K provides two years of Long-Term Support (LTS) for compatibility across Kyverno and Kubernetes versions. This means that you will get critical fixes and CVE support for a given Kyverno release for up to two years.
* **Seamless GitOps Integration:** Easily manage policies with tools like ArgoCD for automated deployment and updates.
* **Proactive Support:** Enterprise support ensures youâ€™re backed by experts who can help with troubleshooting, best practices, and scaling.

## Objective of This Guide
This Proof of Value (POV) document is designed to help you, whether you are new to Kyverno or an existing user of Kyverno, quickly understand the value of upgrading to Enterprise Kyverno. Through this guide, you will experience:

* **Quick Setup:** Achieve a secure baseline for your clusters in minutes with pre-configured policies.
* **Seamless Migration:** Transition from open-source Kyverno to Enterprise Kyverno without downtime or disruption.
* **Policy Lifecycle Management:** Includes best practices for managing the entire lifecycle of policies, from creation to testing and enforcement.
* **Shift Left:** Leverage the [Nirmata CLI](https://docs.nirmata.io/docs/nctl/), included with your Enterprise Kyverno subscription, to integrate policy checks into your CI pipelines. By shifting policy enforcement left in the development lifecycle, your teams can get immediate feedback on misconfigurations before code reaches production.
* **GitOps Integration:** Simplify policy management using ArgoCD, ensuring consistency across clusters.
