## Policy-as-Code Checklist
This checklist outlines the essential features and capabilities required to implement policy-as-code effectively across Kubernetes, Terraform, Dockerfiles, and Cloud Configurations. It serves as a guide to evaluate tools and practices that ensure robust policy management and enforcement.

- [ ] Declarative and Human-Readable Policies
    - Policies are written in a declarative format for easy readability (like YAML) and maintenance.
- [ ] Multi-Platform Support
    - Policies are applicable across Kubernetes, Terraform, Dockerfiles, and cloud resources (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- [ ] GitOps Compatibility
    - Policies integrate with GitOps workflows for version control and automated deployments.
    - Support for tools like Argo CD and Flux to synchronize and enforce policies.
- [ ] Validation and Enforcement at Multiple Stages
    - Policies support validation in CI pipelines.
    - Policies enforce compliance in production environments.
- [ ] Dynamic and Context-Aware Policies
    - Policies adapt to contextual data without requiring custom code.
    - Support for variable substitution and dynamic contexts like Kubernetes labels or Terraform variables.
- [ ] Templating and Reusability
    - Policies are parameterized and reusable to avoid duplication.
    - Templates can enforce standards across platforms such as tagging conventions or security rules.
- [ ] Policy Lifecycle Management
    - Policies are testable, versioned, and easy to update.
    - Tools are provided for testing and lifecycle management of policies.
- [ ] Human-Readable Violation Reports
    - Violation reports are clear, actionable, and accessible via CLI, APIs, or dashboards.
- [ ] Curated Policy Libraries
    - Ready-to-use policies for common use cases, such as security and compliance standards.
- [ ] Centralized Multi-Cluster and Multi-Cloud Management
    - Support for centralized visibility and enforcement across Kubernetes clusters, Terraform configurations, and cloud environments.
- [ ] Compatibility with open-source and easy to extend
    - Built on open-source principles for transparency and extensibility.
    - Extensible to address specific organizational needs.
